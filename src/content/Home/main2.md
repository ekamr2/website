# Corporate

HKN hosts a variety of corporate events that consist of information sessions, tech talks, and resume reviews that are sponsored by companies. These sessions are conducted on campus and give students a chance to learn more about the employer, recent technological advances, or career opportunities. The students have the opportunity to interact with recruiters, ask questions, and express their interest in available opportunities. In addition, we help companies advertise career opportunities and campus events to our students through fliers, email newsletters, building monitors, etc.

# Outreach

HKN hosts outreach events, which are focused on teaching fundamental Electrical and Computer Engineering concepts to the surrounding community through application. Past examples include teaching Boy Scouts circuitry and soldering, hosting info sessions with high school students in the Champaign Public Library to build foundation in electronics. We appreciate any opportunity to give back to the community.

# Social

Throughout the semester, HKN hosts social events ranging from Mario Kart tournaments to ice-skating excursions, providing an occasion for employers to interact with students in a more relaxed setting. We also have weekly Happy Hour sessions at Legends Bar and Grill from 5:00 PM - 6:00 PM on Fridays. Company representatives are welcome to join our preplanned events, but they can also organize their own.
