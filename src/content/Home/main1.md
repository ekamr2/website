# Our Mission

HKN (Eta Kappa Nu) is the international honors society for Electrical and Computer Engineers. Established by Maurice Carr in 1904 with the opening of the Alpha chapter at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, HKN has grown to incorporate over 200 chapters across the world. Outstanding persons are elected to HKN primarily from the junior and senior classes of accredited undergraduate programs, along with graduate students and distinguished professional engineers. Students are chosen based on marked academic performance, personal character, service to the student body, and distinguished accomplishments.

While one of its purposes certainly is the reward of scholarship, Eta Kappa Nu has a far broader purpose than merely to award a badge of distinction to scholars. As conceived by its founders and as carried forward by its members for over two generations, it strives to assist its members throughout their lives in becoming better professionals. HKN encourages members to improve the standards of their profession, courses of instruction, and the institutions where its chapters are established.
