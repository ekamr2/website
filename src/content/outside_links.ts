 * Does the link have an icon?
 *  Yes -> Desktop: shown in navigation bar as icon. Mobile: shown in footer as icon,
 *      and navigation menu as text.
 *  No -> Desktop and mobile: shown only in navigation menu
 *
 * You should import icons from feather following the existing imports below.
 * To find a list of all available feather icons, see https://feathericons.com.
