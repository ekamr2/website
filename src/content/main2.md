# Corporate

This is some text about how great HKN. I am building the website for HKN. This text should be relatively long, but not too long. I still need to refactor the code for this website and add some more new features. This is some more text, HKN does fun events like happy hour. Even more text, and even more text, and even more text! This is a long paragraph, but is necessary to make things look balanced, it's height should be not much less than that of the image below.
